While the WTO is expected to promote trade by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers, existing estimates of its effect on trade vary widely in magnitude, sign, and significance. We collect 2,547 estimates from 71 papers and apply meta-analysis techniques to conduct a systematic quantitative review of the literature, complementing it with established advances in gravity models to obtain estimates of the WTO's impact on trade. The meta-analysis shows that, on average, the literature finds a significant and positive trade effect of the WTO, although the estimates depend strongly on study characteristics. Moreover, we find no evidence of publication bias. Our structural gravity estimates confirm these findings: the WTO increases trade. However, the effects are heterogeneous across sectors and income levels of trading partners.","tags":["World Trade Organization","trade","gravity","meta-analysis"],"title":"Does the WTO promote prade?

Bilateral trade flows for the USSR are collected from the annual statistical yearbooks for foreign trade for the USSR (Внешняя торговля СССР (Статистический обзор)). Trade flows between East and West Germany (West German source) are from the West German Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt).\nMethodology We replicate the exact steps that the IMF would have taken to include these bilateral trade flows in its DOTS database, had it had access to the data in the statistical yearbooks. We use the exchange rates reported in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS), or the official exchange rate if it is not available, to convert trade values from local currency to U.S. dollars. We also make the adjustment for c.i.f./f.o.b. discrepancies recommended by the DOTS methodology (IMF, 2003). In line with general DOTS practice, we update estimates to the latest published value when there are revisions from one year to the next. We have verified that the export values obtained in this way are virtually identical to those reported in DOTS for the years for which they are available for East Germany and the Soviet Union.

Trade between East and West across the Iron Curtain (a symbolical and physical barrier dividing Europe into two distinct areas) was restricted, but the severity of these restrictions varied over time. We quantify the trade and welfare effects of the Iron Curtain and show how the difficulty of trading across the Iron Curtain fluctuated throughout the Cold War. Using a novel dataset on trade between the two economic blocs and a quantitative trade model, we find that while the Iron Curtain at its height represented a tariff equivalent of 48% in 1951, trade between East and West gradually became easier until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Despite the easing of trade restrictions, we estimate that the Iron Curtain roughly halved East-West trade flows and caused substantial welfare losses in the Eastern bloc countries that persisted until the end of the Cold War. Conversely, the Iron Curtain led to an increase in intra-bloc trade, especially in the Eastern bloc, which outpaced the integration of Western Europe in the run-up to the formation of the European Union.","tags":["trade","Cold War","Iron Curtain","geopolitical fragmentation","trade costs","borders"],"title":"The economic consequences of geopolitical fragmentation: Evidence from the Cold War","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodolfo G.

There is, however, a minimum level of debt below which the steady-state inflation deviates from its target due to the zero lower bound on nominal rates. We analyze the response to a debt-financed fiscal expansion and quantify the impact of different timings in the adaptation of the monetary policy rule, as well as the performance of alternative monetary policy rules that do not require an assessment of the natural rates.

Relying on structural gravity models, we first estimate a proxy of trade globalization that captures the ease of trading internationally with respect to trading domestically. Results indicate that the evolution of trade globalization since the mid-1990s has been similar between the two regions, but very heterogeneous within them. Trade globalization has been particularly strong in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, but has lagged in services. The paper also documents that trade globalization has been particularly strong in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, but it lagged in services. Within region heterogeneity is associated to a set of trade policy instruments, including tariffs, non-tariff measures, WTO membership. and trade agreements. Next, we quantify the economic implications of the estimated globalization trends.

In this paper, we use historical bilateral trade flows and a structural gravity model to quantify the evolution of Spain's border thickness, a summary measure of its barriers to international trade. We find that Spain's borders in the period 1948-1975 were thicker than those of any other country in Western Europe, even after the liberalization of trade that started in 1959. These comparatively higher impediments to international trade implied substantial negative effects on consumer welfare.

It analyses the EU's economic interdependencies and their implications for trade and finance, with a focus on strategically important dimensions such as energy, critical raw materials, food, foreign direct investment and financial market infrastructures.

We simulate two scenarios: 1) no agreement with reversion to WTO rules and no special treatment for migrants; 2) signature of a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA). According to our results, Brexit may have large negative effects on trade and migration flows between the EU and the UK. In the WTO scenario, trade flows are predicted to drop by 30% and migration by close to 25%. If the UK and the EU sign an FTA-like agreement (which does not include free mobility of labour), the negative effects on trade are lessened although there is no significant difference in terms of migration with respect to the WTO scenario.","tags":["migration","trade","Brexit"],"title":"An estimation of the effects of Brexit on trade and migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodolfo G.

We derive a “sufficient statistics” formula for optimal UI that is expressed in terms of observable variables and can therefore be used in applied work. Recent research has shown that unemployed households pay less per unit of consumption than employed households. This finding has two counteracting effects on the optimal level of UI. On the one hand, consumption smoothing benefits identified from expenditure data overestimate the true marginal benefits of UI. On the other hand, UI benefits become more valuable because they buy more consumption when unemployed. In an optimal design, which effect dominates depends on the curvature of the utility function. We show that for relative risk aversion larger than one the first effect dominates, leading to lower levels of optimal UI.","tags":["consumption","expenditure","social insurance","sufficient statistics"],"title":"Optimal unemployment insurance: Consumption versus expenditure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodolfo G.

If attacking is relatively safe, attack behavior in the global game and trade in state-contingent assets feed back into each other.
